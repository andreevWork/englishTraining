1
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,120
- Hey, Lacie!
- Hey!

2
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,640
Ryan?

3
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,640
Ryan!

4
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,600
- I was holding a bomb!
<i>- Come on!</i>

5
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,200
Sorry, guys.

6
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Landlord is sending buyers over today
so... put your pants on.

7
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,320
Maybe if I don't,
it'll scare 'em off and we can stay here.

8
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

9
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

10
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,360
Nate's roommate took a job in Phoenix
so I get his place.

11
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,640
- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

12
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,160
I'm... seeing some places over lunch.
Catch you later.

13
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Sorry, that was my sister.

14
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

15
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,800
Jasmine tea?

16
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
And that's one Brushed Suede.

17
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
You want a cookie with that?

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,600
- It's on the house.
- Sounds awesome.

19
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,720
- See you tomorrow, JJ.
- See you, Lacie.

20
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, I saw your boy
in the fire hat just now! So cute!

21
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,640
Yeah, he's really something.

22
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
Hmm.

23
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
Hey, Lacie!

24
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
- Bets, it's great to see you!
- You too.

25
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,360
How's Pancakes?

26
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,640
He's hilarious.
Such a funny cat. Just the best.

27
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,840
- Are you still at Hoddicker?
- Mm-hmm.

28
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,960
- Yeah. It's going pretty great.
- Good to hear.

29
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
- So what brings you back here?
- New job, first day.

30
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,720
- First day?
- At Blankman-Harper.

31
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Whoa! Top floor! That's...

32
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,080
- Well, good luck.
- I know, right?

33
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,480
It's great you're still happy
at Hoddicker.

34
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,800
- Well, maybe not forever.
- No, not forever.

35
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
- But for now...
- It's OK for now.

36
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,160
It's great for now, yes. Yes, it is.

37
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

38
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

39
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,840
They're from the organic stall
at the farmers' market.

40
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,400
Sure. Okay.

41
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,720
Mmm!

42
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Thank you. Thank you.

43
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,880
We're kind of not talking to Ches.

44
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,000
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

45
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Oh...

46
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,480
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

47
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,240
Sure! Obviously.

48
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,840
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

49
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,320
Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

50
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Hello?

51
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,640
- <i>Yo, they're taking it.</i>
- Who?

52
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.</i>

53
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,080
Okay.

54
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,120
So,
now we move into the light space area.

55
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,080
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

56
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,120
- Great food, great company.
- Mm-hmm!

57
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,280
Whoa!

58
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,840
Sampled your photo stream to make her.

59
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,400
Great hair!

60
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,520
Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

61
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh, my God.

62
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
It's hilarious!

63
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
You like him?

64
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,560
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

65
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,880
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

66
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,080
We have unparalleled metrics
on romantic geneses.

67
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,200
Uh-huh.

68
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,720
I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

69
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,920
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

70
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Standard occupancy
on a minimum six-month contract,

71
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,320
we're talking... this much.

72
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,600
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

73
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Okay.

74
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

75
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,680
There's options.

76
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,160
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

77
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,960
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

78
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,160
We'd need you around a 4.5.

79
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,160
4.5?

80
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,400
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

81
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,320
- 4.5.
- That's right.

82
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

83
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,200
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

84
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,720
A two-year-old with a fucking balloon
isn't this happy.

85
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,440
It's actually a pretty cool place.

86
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,600
Like you'd even qualify.

87
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,760
There's nothing I can do, sir.

88
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,280
Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

89
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,840
That's the sense you get just from... me?

90
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,520
From your rep report analytics.

91
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,160
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

92
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

93
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,720
You see, even...

94
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,960
What's that? 8:40 a.m.
You're working hard on your socials.

95
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,000
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

96
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,360
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

97
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Oh, just a workplace thing.

98
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
Okay.
Let's check on your sphere of influence.

99
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,440
Let me zoom out here.

100
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,720
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

101
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,360
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you.

102
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,000
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

103
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
How long do you think?

104
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Well, barring a major setback,

106
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,560
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

107
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,040
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more.

108
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,400
Then you'll need a boost.

109
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

110
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Most of your interactions are confined
to your inner circle

111
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,240
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

112
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,680
Same with your outer circle.

113
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,960
You've got a ton of reciprocal five stars
from service industry workers,

114
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,920
but there's not much else.

115
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,720
At least as far as I can see.

116
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,560
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

117
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,800
Ideally,
that's up votes from quality people.

118
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,280
- Quality people?
- High fours.

119
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,920
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,640
and there's your boost.

121
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,200
- Oh, hi, JJ!
- Hey, Lacie!

122
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,360
- Keith! Hello.
- Lacie!

123
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
- You look great today.
- Thank you!

124
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,440
- Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.
- Sorry, Ches. I'm late.

125
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,440
I just need some stars, please!

126
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,680
Fuck!

127
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,880
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

128
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,240
- How's it going at Blankman?
- Just great.

129
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,520
- Well, I bet you work... good there.
- Thank you.

130
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Would you like a croissant?

131
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,040
They gave me an extra at the coffee place.

132
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,240
- Oh, no, I already ate.
- Okay, sure. All good. Yes.

133
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Yeah.

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Well, here's me, so...

135
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,720
<i>Don't try too hard.
It's impossible to respect.</i>

136
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,240
<i>High fours can smell it a mile off.
Just be you.</i>

137
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
<i>Authentic gestures, that's the key.</i>

138
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,080
<i>- That's time up, I'll catch you later.</i>
- Oh, could I just ask...

139
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,560
..."Mr. Rags."

140
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,480
Shit!

141
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
- What the fuck is that?
- Tapenade. Want some?

142
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,200
Who even are you?

143
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,760
It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan.

144
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,640
Oh, my God.

145
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,800
- What is it?
- Naomi!

146
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,600
Shit!

147
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,880
Old school,<i> el perfecto</i> Naomi?
You guys keep in contact?

148
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
Ryan, just go! Go!

149
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,800
- Oh, my God!
- Nay-Nay, how are you?

150
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
I was just fixing myself a snack.

151
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,120
<i>Oh, Lace, could I just say
I am so happy to see your face?</i>

152
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
- Me too. It's been...
<i>- Too long.</i>

153
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
- Way too long.
<i>- And that's my fault.</i>

154
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
- No, it's mine. Everything is just so...
<i>- Everything's just so...</i>

155
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,200
Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you.

156
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,760
<i>When you posted that Mr. Rags photo...</i>

157
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,760
I know, Mr. Rags!

158
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,760
<i>I just had to call</i>

159
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,080
<i>and talk to you because...</i>

160
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

161
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Wow! That's a... big ring!

162
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,320
Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?

163
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,920
<i>He is great. So smart. Just sweet.</i>

164
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,760
<i>I know you're gonna love him.</i>

165
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Uh-huh.

166
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,680
<i>So, anyways, the big day...</i>

167
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
Yes, when is it?

168
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,440
<i>So, we're getting married in a month</i>

169
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,600
<i>on his family's estate</i>

170
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
<i>up here on the island.</i>

171
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,680
<i>This place outside Port Mary, Honeysuckle.
You heard of it?</i>

172
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
No, but...

173
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,680
<i>Well, it's a private island.</i>

174
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,000
<i>Take a looooook!</i>

175
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,280
Oh, wow! That is...

176
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,760
<i>I know, right? So... can you make it?</i>

177
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,280
Are you kidding? Of course.

178
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,240
<i>Great, cool, cos I was wondering if...</i>

179
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,760
<i>Lace, do you think...</i>

180
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,280
<i>Would you be my maid of honour?</i>

181
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
Seriously?

182
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,160
Oh, my God.

183
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,800
I mean, you've got such cool friends now.
Are you sure?

184
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,560
<i>Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?</i>

185
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,320
- I know but we haven't s...
<i>- I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags...</i>

186
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,920
<i>All the memories.
It just brought things home.</i>

187
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,080
Oh, Nay-Nay.

188
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,760
<i>I know we haven't kept in touch
as much as I'd have liked</i>

189
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,600
<i>and that is totally my fault,
but this is a big day.</i>

190
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,320
<i>A big life day and I want my oldest
friend with me, my oldest friend.</i>

191
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
<i>I want you by my side.</i>

192
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,760
Oh, my God. Thank you.

193
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
What do I have to...

194
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,040
<i>Not much to it. A speech, mainly.</i>

195
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Speech? Of course!

196
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,920
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

197
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,440
<i>Oh, my gosh, like... hundreds!</i>

198
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,040
<i>It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.</i>

199
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,040
<i>Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,</i>

200
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,160
<i>but they're all, like,
4.7 or above.</i>

201
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,520
Uh-huh.

202
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,800
Nay-Nay, I will not let you down.

203
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
<i>Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.</i>

204
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,560
- Sure.
<i>- How we were, any old things.</i>

205
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
- Gotcha.
<i>- I'll ping you some anecdotes.</i>

206
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,880
- That would be great.
<i>- And what's your dress size?</i>

207
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,120
Oh, um...

208
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
<i>I'll tell you what,
I'll just send you a four.</i>

209
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,640
- Perfect.
<i>- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.</i>

210
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,520
<i>Well, anyway...</i>

211
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
<i>Love you, Lay.</i>

212
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,600
You too, Nay-Nay!

213
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,480
Oh!

214
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,240
<i>Bye.</i>

215
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,200
What was that? The F-word?

216
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,480
You two pussy pals now?

217
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
Shut up.

218
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,800
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

219
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,560
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

220
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

221
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
She fucked Greg.

222
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,680
She... did not fuck Greg.

223
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,560
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

224
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,320
Okay.

225
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
Impressive.

226
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,680
- Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,480
<i>Pelican Cove.</i>

228
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,680
Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the place
yesterday. I wanna take it.

229
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
<i>That's fantastic!</i>

230
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,480
<i>Uh... Oh, I see you're still on a 4.2.
Is that, um...</i>

231
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,400
Yep, I'm on it,
just gonna transfer the deposit now.

232
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
<i>- Well, okay.</i>
- Yes!

233
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,160
In this world,
we're all so caught up in our own heads.

234
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,240
It's easy to lose sight of what's real.
What matters.

235
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,760
But as I stand here today...

236
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,120
seeing the joy Paul has brought
to Naomi's life,

237
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,840
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

238
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
Nay-Nay,

239
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,280
the little girl who, when we were just
five-years-old in art camp,

240
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,560
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

241
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,520
- The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags.
- I still have him.

242
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,760
He sits on my desk and...

243
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,480
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

244
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
What she meant to me then and now.

245
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,440
I am so honored to be here

246
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,600
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

247
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
I love you, Nay-Nay.

248
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,800
Is the tear too much?

249
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,720
You fucking sociopath.

250
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,800
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

251
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,760
I do keep him on my desk.

252
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,680
There's sugary
and then there's fucking diabetes.

253
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,560
I just wanna make her happy
on her wedding day.

254
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,560
The captive audience of 4-point holies
five-starring your ass off,

255
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,720
that's just a bonus.

256
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,080
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- Come on...

257
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,040
I wish her well
and wanna express it the best I can.

258
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,560
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

259
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,040
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

260
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,960
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

261
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Unh-unh.
You get points from your gaming buddies.

262
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,720
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

263
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,040
Pelican Cove higher?

264
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,960
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

265
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,960
They are fake-smile jail cells.

266
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Great. Car cancelled.

267
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,920
And he marked me down so now I have
to book another, and I took a ding.

268
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,640
- Great job.
- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

269
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,760
Before this obsession,
when we had conversations, remember?

270
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
I need my charger.

271
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,360
This whole ranking thing,
just comparing yourself to people who...

272
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,600
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

273
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,440
I said don't borrow this!

274
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,640
High fours like Naomi,
I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

275
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,360
My car is here. Again.

276
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,560
Your Pelican Cove deposit,
is it refundable?

277
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
Like, what if this doesn't work?

278
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
- Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

279
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,920
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

280
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,920
living with you hasn't been
one big rainbow sandwich for me.

281
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,600
Do you know why
I never brought any guys back here?

282
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,160
Because I didn't want them
to know I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

283
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,280
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

284
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Good luck with your performance!

285
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,760
Oh, hi, hi! I'm coming. I'm coming.

286
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,240
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

287
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,360
That's great. Just great.

288
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,440
Oh... Hi.

289
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,600
Nay-Nay!

290
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,720
<i>Hey, Lace! Just checking in.</i>

291
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,920
I'm on my way to the airport right now.

292
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,280
<i>Okay, cool, and you're all good
for the rehearsal dinner?</i>

293
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,160
Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?
That restaurant looks so cool.

294
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,080
<i>- Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?</i>
- Mm-hmm. In my case.

295
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,440
<i>- I love the pink.</i>
- Uh-huh.

296
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
So the latest draft
of the speech is great.

297
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,560
Going handwritten's so cool.

298
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Those scans of the page,
my God, I welled up just at that.

299
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,800
<i>- Oh, thank you!</i>
- Um... just one thought.

300
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,880
<i>That whole bit where I help you
with the eating disorder thing...</i>

301
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,120
- You think that's a little...
<i>- A little over-sharing, yeah.</i>

302
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,160
You're so right. It's gone.

303
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,120
<i>Okay. Cool.
Well, I'll see you in a few hours!</i>

304
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,120
And here's your tip. Thank you.

305
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh, come on.

306
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,400
<i>May I have your attention, please...</i>

307
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,520
- Hi there, how are you doing?
- I am wonderful.

308
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,160
I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled.

309
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,600
- No. No, no, no.
- Customer incident at the other end.

310
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,000
But... So when is the next flight?

311
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

312
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,760
Uh... I booked this weeks ago.
It's my best friend's wedding.

313
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,920
- I'm sorry.
- I have to get there. I have to.

314
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
Okay... let's see what we can do.

315
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,960
Thank you. Thank you so much.

316
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,560
I see there's one standby seat
on another plane leaving tonight.

317
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,240
Uh...

318
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,840
That's reserved for members
of our Prime Flight Programme.

319
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,840
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

320
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,200
- Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.
- Uh-huh.

321
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

322
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,640
Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um...

323
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Some woman dinged me down in the...
Can't you just...

324
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm sorry, it won't let me book it
without the correct ranking.

325
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,920
- But it's so close.
- There's just nothing I can do.

326
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
- Christ, I mean, surely.
- I'm gonna have to ask you

327
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
to moderate your language there.

328
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,160
Sorry. It's just...

329
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm maid of honour.
I cannot miss this wedding.

330
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,120
And I am so sorry about that.

331
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,960
- Can you call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

332
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,600
- Can you just call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

333
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,520
- Call the fucking supervisor!
- Okay, that's profanity.

334
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
- We're zero tolerance on profanity.
- I'm sorry. It's just...

335
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,520
- I have to serve the next customer.
- No, no, no, no.

336
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
- Can you step away, ma'am?
- God, just fucking help me!

337
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Ooh.

338
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm so sorry.

339
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,280
- I've called security.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that.

340
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars.

341
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,840
- What's the issue here, Hannah?
- Intimidation and profanity.

342
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,240
- Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.
- Don't speak, ma'am.

343
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,040
- I was just trying to...
- Ma'am.

344
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,640
Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

345
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

346
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,960
to dock you one full ranking point
as a punitive measure.

347
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,880
- This is a temporary measure.
- No!

348
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,600
- Your score reverts to normal in 24 hours.
- No, no, no. But I need it now.

349
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,120
During this period, all down votes
are subject to a times two multiplier.

350
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,240
Times two?

351
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
We recommend you avoid negative feedback
at this time.

352
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm on double damage?

353
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,560
Please, remove yourself
from the airport immediately.

354
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,840
<i>Okay, well, due to your ranking...</i>

355
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,720
Hi there. Chuck! Great name.

356
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,560
- Thank you.
- Hope you're having a great night.

357
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,320
- It's pretty good.
- So I need a car.

358
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,480
- You got a vehicle in mind?
- Anything, really.

359
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,200
Well, due to your current ranking,

360
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,040
you're restricted
to our super saver fleet.

361
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,000
- Yep. That's... Yeah.
- I-Cruiser 2?

362
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
They still have the 2?

363
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,200
Oh, God.

364
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,800
Oh, come on.

365
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,600
Uh...

366
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Damn it!

367
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,560
The little girl, who when we were both
five years old in art camp,

368
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,600
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

369
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,480
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...

370
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,120
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild.
You can do this.

371
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,960
- Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.
<i>- How far away are you?</i>

372
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.

373
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,080
<i>- What?</i>
- Well, not missed it but...

374
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,000
<i>So you're not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner?</i>

375
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,360
- No.
<i>- Lacie!</i>

376
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,280
I am so sorry. It's been...

377
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,240
I got a rental car. I'm driving.

378
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,160
Driving? That's like nine hours.

379
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,560
<i>I'm making good time,</i>

380
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,080
gonna go through the night,
make a road trip out of it.

381
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,520
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

382
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,280
<i>I can find a replacement
if something's wrong.</i>

383
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,280
No. No. No. I'll be there.
I swear on Mr. Rags.

384
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,760
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

385
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,880
Okay, just drive safe!

386
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,560
You bet. I'll just...

387
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,080
Come on.

388
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,600
Come on.

389
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,960
Please.

390
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,680
Okay.

391
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,000
What do you want?

392
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,720
Oh, shit.

393
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,840
Hi. Sorry.

394
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,680
Your charger doesn't fit my car.

395
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,320
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

396
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,360
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

397
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,120
No. Do you have one?

398
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,880
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

399
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,000
You're super helpful.

400
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,800
Two stars?!

401
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,080
Two stars?

402
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,280
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

403
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,720
Sir, excuse me.

404
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,480
Excuse me, sorry.

405
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,240
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

406
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,960
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

407
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,040
Sure.

408
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,960
Great.

409
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,680
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

410
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,000
I have a rental car. It's...

411
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,800
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- She's, like, 2.8.

412
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,000
Come on!

413
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,840
I didn't even do anything!

414
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,240
You look like you need a ride.

415
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,040
Um...

416
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,920
Actually, I'm okay.

417
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,560
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

418
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,880
Blue thermos is coffee, red's whiskey.
Help yourself.

419
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,800
I'm okay. Thanks.

420
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,240
Where are you headed?

421
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,120
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great.

422
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,640
Checking my feed for danger signs?

423
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,720
I get it a lot.
1.4 gotta be an antisocial maniac, right?

424
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,000
- You seem...
- Normal?

425
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,280
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

426
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,360
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

427
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,120
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

428
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,800
That's not... This is temporary.

429
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,000
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

430
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,240
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

431
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,880
Wanna hear my speech?

432
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,680
No.

433
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,680
So how come you're a 2.8?

434
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,200
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

435
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,880
and they put me on double damage.

436
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,120
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

437
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
I meant the yelling.

438
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,360
I don't know. I was mad.

439
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,440
Look at where it got me.

440
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,600
But as long as I get to the wedding,
do the speech,

441
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,080
they'll overlook the 2.8.
I'm with the bride.

442
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
And if I do well,
well, they're all high fours

443
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,440
so that velocitates my arc.

444
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,120
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

445
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,760
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

446
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,040
God, you remind me of me.

447
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,560
- Hmm.
- Not now.

448
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,120
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

449
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,920
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

450
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,520
All the work I put in...

451
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,680
Eight years ago,
Tom, my husband, got cancer.

452
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,000
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

453
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,560
I'm so sorry.

454
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,000
You don't know me
so you're not really sorry.

455
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,320
You're just mainly awkward
cos I have sprung some cancer talk at you.

456
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,880
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

457
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,520
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

458
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,360
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

459
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,160
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

460
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,280
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

461
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,040
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

462
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,040
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

463
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,520
Tom was a 4.3.

464
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,000
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

465
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,160
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

466
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,560
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

467
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
Just drop it out there.

468
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,680
People don't always like that.

469
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,960
It is incredible
how fast you slip off the ladder

470
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,720
when you start doing that.

471
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,320
It turned out a lot of my friends
didn't care for honesty.

472
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,640
Treated me like I had taken a shit
at their breakfast table.

473
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,720
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

474
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,280
Shedding those fuckers.

475
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,040
It was like taking off tight shoes.

476
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,720
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on.

477
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,080
Why not?

478
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,800
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

479
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,240
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

480
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,560
Look, you had something with your life,

481
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,320
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

482
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,960
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

483
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,880
But I don't even have the something
worth losing, not yet.

484
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,400
You know,
I mean, I'm still fighting for that.

485
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,600
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

486
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,960
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

487
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,560
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

488
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,920
Like just...
And that is way off, like, way, way off.

489
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,840
And until I get there,
I have to play the numbers game.

490
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,640
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

491
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,680
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

492
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I do not mean that how it sounds.

493
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,800
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

494
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,920
- Sweetheart.
- What time is it?

495
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,240
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

496
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,400
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

497
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,720
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

498
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,040
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

499
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,440
I put a little something in there
for you.

500
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,560
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

501
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,280
Bye.

502
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,320
In this world,
we're all so caught up...

503
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,560
...in our own dramas.

504
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,800
- So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

505
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,080
He'd never even heard of the show.

506
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,440
I'm like, "You never heard
of<i> Sea of Tranquillity?"</i>

507
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,160
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

508
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,160
and he's all like, "What
the fuck?" Whatever!

509
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,400
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

510
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,720
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary."

511
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,400
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

512
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,320
He's all like, "Uh... Port Mary is
frickin' miles away."

513
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,440
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

514
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,320
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

515
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,800
- See you back on there.
- Okay.

516
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,400
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

517
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,440
- You're into<i> Sea of Tranquillity?</i>
- Totally.

518
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,040
I was all set to go.

519
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,840
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

520
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,200
Well, there's some space in the RV.

521
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
- Hi.
- Hey!

522
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,320
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

523
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,640
Trank head.<i> Sea of Tranquillity</i> fan?

524
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,280
Oh, yeah.
We say Tranksters where I'm from.

525
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,920
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

526
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,760
- She's awesome.
- She?

527
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,040
He! I misspoke.

528
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,800
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

529
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,400
I know, and that's why
it's so hard to remember, right?

530
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,440
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

531
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,200
My friend, at the convention.

532
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,280
Hi, Nay!

533
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,640
So, oh, my God,
insane night, but I am so close now.

534
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,240
<i>Don't come.</i>

535
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,840
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

536
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,880
Don't come. I don't want you here.

537
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,480
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

538
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,840
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

539
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,160
<i>Well, the wedding's today so...</i>

540
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,720
- But it doesn't change anything.
<i>- Lacie...</i>

541
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,920
- I can still do the same speech.
<i>- Lacie...</i>

542
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,240
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

543
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,920
<i>But... But you invited me.</i>

544
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,600
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

545
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,040
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

546
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,760
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

547
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,760
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

548
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,920
<i>When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?</i>

549
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,320
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

550
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,360
played fantastically
on all the stimulations we ran.

551
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,640
Forecast was a prestige bounce
of .2 minimum.

552
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,240
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

553
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,960
That just puts the stink on things
a little too much.

554
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,160
That just plays badly for us.

555
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,640
So it was just about numbers for you?

556
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,800
Oh, cut the shit!
It was numbers for both of us.

557
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,760
<i>You wanted those primo votes,
don't deny it.</i>

558
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,840
<i>It's not like you could get them
on your own. Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

559
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,280
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

560
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,640
What? You're just gonna roll up here
and make people like you?

561
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,320
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

562
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,760
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

563
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,840
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

564
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,880
Hello?

565
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,520
Fuck!

566
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,360
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

567
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,760
Hope they cancel it!

568
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,360
I need a ride!

569
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,600
Fuck!

570
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,720
Jesus!

571
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,800
Hey! Hey!

572
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,440
Hey!

573
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,800
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

574
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,000
Can I borrow your bike?

575
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,000
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

576
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,000
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

577
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,960
To love him, comfort him,

578
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,640
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

579
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,120
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

580
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,960
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

581
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,040
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

582
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,600
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

583
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,840
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

584
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,520
He's still got a few bullets left.
Oh, man.

585
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,640
Oh, gosh, well, um...

586
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,800
Shit!

587
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,280
We have so many people to thank.
Our beautiful bridesmaids.

588
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,160
But, of course,

589
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,240
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

590
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,600
are to someone who's my best friend,

591
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,720
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

592
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,320
Naomi!

593
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,640
One, two, three! Naomi!

594
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,920
The A Team!

595
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,360
I love you so much, darl.

596
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,960
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

597
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,000
Congratulations, sir.

598
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,880
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

599
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,040
Get over here!

600
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,640
Get your ass over here.

601
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,320
Get in here, big boy.

602
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,440
You're beautiful!

603
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,320
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

604
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,800
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

605
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,960
Everybody, hello!

606
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,080
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

607
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,880
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

608
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,600
Thank you.

609
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,080
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

610
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,400
She's a fucking 1.1.

611
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,840
Now for those of you who don't know me,
which is... all of you...

612
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,880
my name is Lacie Pound

613
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,800
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

614
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,520
Hi, Nay-Nay!

615
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,840
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

616
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,720
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

617
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,200
Pretty big deal.

618
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,920
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

619
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Uh...

620
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,480
Anyway, um... I...

621
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,560
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

622
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,520
We met when we were five years old,

623
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,760
and right up through to our
teenage years, we made quite the pair.

624
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,720
We'd talk about all the things
girls talk about,

625
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,080
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys.

626
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,720
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

627
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,480
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

628
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,480
Go on.

629
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,400
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

630
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,000
Whoo!

631
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,520
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

632
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,120
You know, fuck the planet!

633
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,600
Fuck the planet!

634
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,440
Anyway...

635
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,480
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

636
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:38,840
which meant she was looking down on me.

637
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,680
Always with a smile though.

638
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,320
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

639
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,680
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

640
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,320
They'd see Naomi and just...
Whoo! You know, that was it.

641
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:04,040
She had this tight ass,

642
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,240
like two fists.

643
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,000
Uh-huh.

644
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,120
I was all like...

645
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,240
I was like...

646
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,160
through the hallways in high school.

647
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,280
And she was there for me.

648
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,160
Holding my hair back...

649
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,040
as I knelt,
vomiting, in front of the crapper.

650
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,120
Thank you for that, Naomi.

651
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,040
I always wished I was you.

652
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,600
And...

653
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,920
I guess that's why you kept me around
so long?

654
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,080
Until you got your new job

655
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,120
and your fancy new friends.

656
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,440
And that...

657
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,520
...fucking... jackhole!

658
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,800
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

659
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,240
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

660
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,080
I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

661
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,840
Stay back.

662
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,320
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

663
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,240
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

664
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,080
Time's nearly up!

665
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,280
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

666
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,360
I just wanted to say, in this world
so caught up in our own shit,

667
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,840
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

668
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,400
Happiness, fucking Paul and Naomi,
and she's...

669
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,000
She... She fucked Greg!

670
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,520
I know she did.

671
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,480
- I know you did.
- No...

672
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,840
Don't even try to deny...

673
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,680
The little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

674
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,440
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

675
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,560
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

676
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:50,160
He reminds me of you
and what you meant to me then!

677
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,800
And I'm so honoured to be here
to see this shit!

678
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,920
I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

679
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,280
I love you!

680
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,280
What the fuck are you looking at?

681
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,400
Just what I was wondering.

682
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,680
Well...

683
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,560
Don't!

684
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,280
Don't? Don't wonder?

685
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,520
Uh-huh.

686
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,240
- It would be a dull world without wonder.
- I don't give a shit about your world.

687
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't like your brassiere.

688
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,880
I don't like your moustache.

689
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,080
I don't like your aura.

690
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,400
- My aura?
- Yeah.

691
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,920
I don't like your... head.

692
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,680
Your entire head is just ridiculous to me.

693
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,920
Really?

694
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,800
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

695
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,360
You sound like a lost little lamb

696
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,920
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

697
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,880
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

698
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,560
to brew you up in the womb?

699
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,320
At least I look like I was born,

700
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,880
not shit out by some tormented
cow creature in an underground lab.

701
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,640
You got tossed out of that lab.

702
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,200
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

703
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,120
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

704
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,760
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

705
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,720
Fucking biological car crash

706
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
that made Picasso screw his eyes upƒ
and say,

707
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,360
"Well, that just don't make sense."

708
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,840
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

709
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,600
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

710
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,520
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
